# CryptographyPR
Cryptography exercises for my bachelor's degree in computer science.

Basically, in the university they gives us the test suite for each function that is in the skeleton. And we have to make the code in order to pass the tests.

You will find both the skeletons and the tests in each PR folder. In order to run the tests you have to run:

````
python <file_name>.py
````
